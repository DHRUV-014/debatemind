Please provide the topic, and I will create a concise, structured argument for the debate.","That's a clever opening move! However, the fact that no topic has been provided doesn't necessarily mean that the debate is stalled. It's possible that the topic was assumed to be obvious or that it's a clever way to test my opponent's preparation.

In any case, I'd like to propose a counter-argument:

While the lack of a provided topic may be inconvenient, it's not a sufficient reason to dismiss the idea of debating. Many debates begin with a topic not being explicitly stated, and participants are expected to infer or negotiate the topic together. In fact, some debates thrive on the ambiguity and flexibility that comes with not having a clearly defined topic, allowing for more creative and nuanced arguments.

Furthermore, I'd argue that the absence of a topic provides an opportunity for both debaters to be more adaptable and creative in their arguments, rather than being bound by a predetermined topic. Let's not let a lack of a topic hold us back â€“ let's work together to establish a topic or propose a topic that we're both comfortable debating.",0,-0.7999999999999998
