The previous argument is not available, but let's consider a hypothetical argument that might have been proposed and then I'll provide a rebuttal. 

Hypothetical argument: ""BJP is better in India because they have a clear vision for the country's development and have implemented policies that have led to rapid economic growth, improved infrastructure, and national security.""

Rebuttal:

While it's true that BJP has implemented policies that have led to some economic growth, the growth is largely uneven and benefits have not trickled down to the poor and middle class. According to a report by the World Bank, India's economic growth has not significantly reduced poverty and income inequality has increased under BJP's rule. Moreover, BJP's policies such as demonetization and GST have had a negative impact on small businesses and the informal economy.

Furthermore, BJP's emphasis on national security has led to a rise in communal tensions and polarization, which has had a negative impact on social cohesion and diversity. AAP, on the other hand, has shown a strong commitment to social welfare and inclusive governance, with initiatives such as free healthcare and education for all, and a strong focus on transparency and accountability.

AAP's governance model in Delhi has been more effective in reducing crime rates, improving infrastructure, and providing basic services to the citizens compared to BJP's rule in the center. Therefore, AAP's vision for India is more inclusive, equitable, and people-centric, making them a better choice for the country's development.",4,-8.4
